# Road-Buddy


## Overall Concept 

‘10-44’ is the winning application of General Assembly’s first West Coast Hackathon. The hackathon theme was to create an application that would help delivery drivers during the holidays. ‘10-44’ matches users based on shared interests to help address the loneliness long-haul truckers face during busy working seasons. This app was created by an eight-person cross-functional team consisting of four software engineers and four UX/UI designers in less than 3 days. 

‘10-44’ is a full-stack Express/Node/Mongoose application that uses EJS templating to render dynamic web pages. It features a robust, session-based user auth system, an efficient matching algorithm that pairs users based on shared interests, and a working two way messaging system so users can communicate directly on the app. The app demonstrates full CRUD functionality, RESTful routing, a mobile-centered design, and a clean, modern user interface.
